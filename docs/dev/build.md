# Build

## Build variables

The package build, `uv sync` or `pip install`, compiles the package only: `[tool.pcons]` in
`pyproject.toml` sets both variables below to `OFF`. A pcons build defaults both to `ON`, but a
build directory keeps the values it was last configured with, and the package build configures
`build/` with both `OFF`.

| Variable | Default | `OFF` skips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POPCORN_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | native tests, test firmware, the header check, `popcorn_testing._smoke`, the firmware packages of `deps.toml`, but doctest is still fetched |
| `POPCORN_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` | example firmware, and the firmware packages when tests are off too |

Each takes `ON`, `OFF`, `1` or `0`, in any case. Anything else stops the configure.

pcons keeps a `KEY=value` variable in the build directory, and the package build uses `build/`.
After a `uv sync`, or any `uv run` that re-syncs the editable package, pass both `ON` once to get
the tests and examples back:

```sh
uv run --no-sync pcons -B build POPCORN_BUILD_TESTS=ON POPCORN_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
```

`pcons run check` passes both `ON` itself.

The `release` variant, the default, builds Unicorn with `UC_LOAD_HELPER_NO_STACK_PROTECTOR`.
It drops the stack protector from Unicorn's guest load helper, 7 host instructions fewer per
MMIO read. The `debug`, `asan` and `tsan` variants and a Unicorn build outside popcorn keep it.
